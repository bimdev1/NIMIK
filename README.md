# NIMIK (National Index of Missing Indigenous Kin)

**NIMIK** is an open-source, trauma-informed archive preserving public data on Missing and Murdered Indigenous People (MMIP) across North America. It is built in collaboration with kinship, sovereignty, and survivorship—not extraction or institutional erasure.

This project exists to restore **visibility**, **accountability**, and **community ownership** to cases that have long been ignored, mishandled, or actively concealed.

---

## Project Scope

NIMIK is not just a database—it is a modular, community-driven system designed to:

- Aggregate and verify public MMIP data
- Provide a searchable, accessible, and trauma-informed public interface
- Offer tools for kin, journalists, advocates, and tribal orgs to access and use case data
- Model ethical, decolonial approaches to open-source software development

The system includes:

- **CLI Tool** for terminal-based search and ingestion
- **Public UI** for accessible, trauma-informed exploration
- **Read-only API** for programmatic access
- **Documentation Suite** covering everything from values to technical pipeline

---

## Who This Is For

NIMIK serves multiple audiences:

- **Families & Kin** seeking visibility and justice  
- **Journalists & Researchers** accessing verified public data  
- **Advocates & Community Organizers** tracking patterns and state neglect  
- **Developers** supporting trauma-informed, anti-carceral systems  
- **Educators & Historians** working on MMIP accountability  

---

## Ethics & Philosophy

NIMIK is built on **non-extractive**, **trauma-informed**, and **anti-carceral** principles.  
We do not “collect” cases—we preserve them.  
We do not centralize data for control—we build decentralized accountability.

We believe:

- Public data is not neutral  
- Families deserve agency over their stories  
- Tools must be built with—not just for—their communities  

See [PHILOSOPHY.md](./PHILOSOPHY.md) for full values and design ethics.

## Project Roadmap

### **Phase 1 – Groundwork (In Progress)**
- [x] Define modular architecture (CLI, UI, API, Docs)
- [x] Publish ethical and philosophical foundations
- [x] Outline project questions and design decisions
- [ ] Identify and verify initial public data sources
- [ ] Prototype CLI search tool
- [ ] Draft trauma-informed UX guidelines
- [ ] Build internal data processing and quality controls

### **Phase 2 – Public Access & Community Feedback**
- [ ] Launch read-only public UI with basic search
- [ ] Publish initial dataset (limited scope, clearly sourced)
- [ ] Host community feedback sessions with Indigenous orgs
- [ ] Begin compiling FOIA documentation + backlog sources
- [ ] Draft long-term data governance and community maintenance model

### **Phase 3 – Decentralization & Stewardship**
- [ ] Implement decentralized data ingestion and case editing via peer review
- [ ] Integrate community-submitted corrections and archival material
- [ ] Develop multilingual support (esp. Indigenous languages)
- [ ] Release API with usage limits and built-in ethical guardrails
- [ ] Transition stewardship to a cross-organizational coalition
