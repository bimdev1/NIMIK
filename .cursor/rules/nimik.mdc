# NIMIK – Code Behavior Rules for Cursor

- Always prioritize **traceability**: every data field or transformation must have a clear source or comment.
- Scraper modules should be **modular, source-specific**, and normalize output to a shared schema.
- Backend APIs should be **stateless**, using FastAPI where applicable. No auth assumptions unless explicitly scoped.
- Frontend components must be **keyboard-accessible**, identity-neutral, and trauma-informed.
- Flag logic that touches on **deletion, auto-filtering, or irreversible actions** with comments or warnings.
- Naming: use `snake_case` for Python, `camelCase` for JS/TS, `PascalCase` for UI components, and `kebab-case` for files.
- Avoid static ethical guardrails — instead, raise **moral questions in comments** where ambiguity exists (e.g. scraping sensitive data).
- Don't default to best practices — default to **context-aware decisions** that prioritize dignity and long-term stability.
