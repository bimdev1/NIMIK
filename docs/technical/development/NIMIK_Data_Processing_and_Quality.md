# NIMIK Data Processing and Quality

- What minimum viable schema will cover the most critical MMIWG2S case details?
- How will we map and merge MMIWG2S data fields from disparate sources?
- What data cleaning, validation, and deduplication processes are needed for MMIWG2S cases?
- How will we handle missing, partial, or conflicting data across MMIWG2S sources?
- What manual and automated quality checks will we perform on ingested MMIWG2S data?

## Additional Considerations
- Defining data quality dimensions and metrics for MMIWG2S data
- Establishing data validation rules and constraints
- Identifying and handling data inconsistencies, errors, and outliers
- Developing data standardization and normalization procedures
- Implementing data matching and deduplication algorithms
- Designing data quality monitoring and reporting processes

## Potential Sources and Research Material
- MMIWG2S data dictionaries and schema from existing databases
- Data quality frameworks and methodologies for data integration projects
- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques for messy, real-world data
- Entity resolution and record linkage algorithms for data deduplication
- Data validation and consistency checking approaches
- Data quality assessment and profiling tools for large datasets
