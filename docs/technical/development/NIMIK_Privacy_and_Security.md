# NIMIK Privacy and Security

- What personally identifiable information (PII) will we exclude or obfuscate in MMIWG2S cases?
- How will we protect sensitive MMIWG2S case details from unauthorized access or misuse?
- What processes will allow MMIWG2S individuals and tribes to manage or remove their data?
- How will we navigate jurisdictional boundaries and data sharing agreements for MMIWG2S cases?
- What security measures will we implement to safeguard the aggregated MMIWG2S dataset?

## Additional Considerations
- Defining sensitive data elements and personally identifiable information (PII) specific to MMIWG2S cases and individuals
- Establishing data classification and handling procedures for MMIWG2S records based on sensitivity and risk levels
- Implementing data anonymization techniques to protect the identities of MMIWG2S individuals in the database
- Developing granular access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can view and edit MMIWG2S case details
- Creating data retention and deletion processes to remove MMIWG2S records at the request of families or communities
- Ensuring compliance with tribal, federal, and state/provincial privacy laws and regulations relevant to MMIWG2S data
- Conducting regular privacy impact assessments and security audits to identify and mitigate risks to MMIWG2S data
