# NIMIK Search and Analysis

- What search fields and filters are most critical for target MMIWG2S user groups?
- How will we optimize performance for large-scale, multi-field search of MMIWG2S cases?
- What geospatial and temporal analysis capabilities are needed for MMIWG2S data?
- How will we enable saved searches, alerts, and data exports for MMIWG2S researchers?
- What visualizations and summary statistics will aid in pattern recognition for MMIWG2S cases?

## Additional Considerations
- Identifying common search and analysis scenarios for MMIWG2S users
- Designing intuitive search interfaces and query builders
- Implementing efficient indexing and query optimization techniques
- Integrating geospatial and temporal search capabilities
- Developing data export and API access methods for researchers
- Creating interactive visualizations and dashboards for data exploration
- Enabling customizable alerts and notifications for search results

## Potential Sources and Research Material
- User research and search behavior analysis for MMIWG2S stakeholders
- Search engine architecture and indexing approaches for large datasets
- Geospatial and temporal data indexing and querying techniques
- Data visualization libraries and tools for web-based data exploration
- Data export formats and API design best practices for data sharing
- Alerting and notification mechanisms for saved searches and updates
- Case studies of search and analysis features in similar data platforms
