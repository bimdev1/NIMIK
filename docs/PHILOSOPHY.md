NIMIK exists because too many Indigenous people go missing and too many systems look away. This database wasn’t created to make a statement—it was created to be useful. Practical. Honest. Something that can help where help has been missing.

This is not a neutral project. It’s not state-aligned or sanitized for institutional comfort. It’s built to serve Indigenous communities, first and only.

## 1. Center the Families, Not the State

Law enforcement may use this data, but they are not the priority. The families are. The communities are. The aunties keeping the records in binders. The people posting flyers no one else prints. NIMIK stands with them, not above them.

## 2. Respect Indigenous Sovereignty

This database does not override tribal authority. It doesn’t claim ownership over any data. If a community asks to modify or remove information about their people, we honor that. Period.

## 3. No Extractive Data Practices

We don’t gather data for the sake of volume. We don’t scrape stories without care. Every entry is treated with the weight it deserves. Nothing is here unless it serves a purpose—and that purpose must benefit the people, not the system.

## 4. People Over Cases

These aren’t case numbers. They’re people. Some have names. Some don’t yet. All deserve dignity. Every detail is written, stored, and displayed with the understanding that someone loved them—and may still be searching.

## 5. Built for Action, Not Storage

This isn’t an archive for policymakers to ignore. It’s a working tool. It should help find patterns, surface connections, support organizing, and make advocacy easier. A static dataset isn’t enough. NIMIK is made to move.

## 6. Always in Progress

We don’t believe in perfection. We believe in listening. This project will evolve based on what communities need—not what outsiders expect. If it fails, we’ll fix it. If it harms, we’ll repair it. But it won’t be frozen. It’ll keep learning.

Let the entries speak. Let the patterns speak. Let the silence they reveal say what needs to be said.
