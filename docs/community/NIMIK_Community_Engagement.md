# NIMIK Community Engagement

- How will we build trust and partnerships with MMIWG2S communities and organizations?
- What governance structures will ensure MMIWG2S leadership and oversight?
- How will we handle MMIWG2S data access and usage requests from external parties?
- What processes will we put in place to respond to MMIWG2S community concerns or incidents?
- How will we share decision-making and resource allocation with MMIWG2S community partners?

## Additional Considerations
- Identifying and prioritizing MMIWG2S community stakeholders, including families, tribal leaders, community advocates, and service providers
- Developing a community engagement plan to build trust and partnerships with MMIWG2S communities throughout the project lifecycle
- Establishing a community advisory board or steering committee to guide NIMIK's development and ensure alignment with MMIWG2S community needs
- Creating data governance policies and procedures in collaboration with MMIWG2S community representatives to ensure ethical and responsible data practices
- Implementing a clear and transparent data request and approval process for external parties seeking to access NIMIK's MMIWG2S database
- Developing crisis communication plans and response protocols for incidents involving MMIWG2S data or impacted communities
- Establishing regular community feedback and consultation mechanisms to gather input and guidance from MMIWG2S stakeholders
- Providing training, resources, and capacity building opportunities to support MMIWG2S community participation and data sovereignty

## Potential Sources and Research Material
- MMIWG2S community engagement frameworks and best practices developed by Indigenous organizations and advocates
- Stakeholder mapping and analysis techniques tailored to the unique relationships and dynamics within MMIWG2S communities
- Participatory governance models and case studies from Indigenous-led data stewardship and research initiatives
- Data governance frameworks and policies designed for Indigenous data sovereignty and community-owned information
- Data sharing agreement templates and examples specific to MMIWG2S data exchange with external parties
- Crisis communication and incident response planning guides relevant to MMIWG2S data management and community interactions
- Capacity building and training curricula on tribal data governance, community-based research, and MMIWG2S advocacy
