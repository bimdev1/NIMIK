# NIMIK Data Sourcing and Aggregation

- What are our criteria for determining which MMIWG2S data sources to include?
- How will we prioritize and sequence the integration of different source types?
- What outreach and partnerships are needed to access relevant tribal and community MMIWG2S data?
- How will we handle MMIWG2S data sources with varying licenses, usage restrictions, or quality levels?
- What attribution and provenance information will we maintain for each MMIWG2S record?

## Additional Considerations 
- Identifying authoritative and credible MMIWG2S data sources, such as law enforcement databases, community-maintained lists, and existing MMIWG2S registries
- Assessing data quality, completeness, and timeliness of MMIWG2S sources to prioritize integration efforts
- Determining data integration requirements to merge MMIWG2S records from disparate sources into a unified database schema
- Establishing data sharing agreements with tribal, community, and government partners to access sensitive MMIWG2S case information
- Documenting data lineage and attribution details to respect the provenance and ownership of MMIWG2S data by originating communities
- Implementing data versioning to track updates and changes to MMIWG2S records over time as new information becomes available

## Potential Sources and Research Material
- Existing MMIWG2S databases, such as NamUs, NAMUS, and state/provincial missing persons registries 
- MMIWG2S data collection and reporting protocols developed by tribal and community organizations
- Data sharing agreement templates and MOUs specific to sensitive, community-owned data
- Data integration best practices and tools for merging missing persons records from multiple sources
- Metadata standards and provenance tracking approaches relevant to MMIWG2S data management
